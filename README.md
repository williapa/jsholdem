# JSHOLDEM

JS Hold 'em is a simple heads up no-limit texas hold 'em web app I made with angular js many years ago.

It's been my github page for, well, forever. but I am moving it into its own repository so it may be more accurately labelled. 

# About

everything is already compiled into the index.html, including the contents of poker.js and poker.css. That's right.  

At some point I had a test file, which is referenced in comments, but it seems to be missing now....oh dear. 

# Gameplay

user actions are announced with window.alert. This can be confusing, because it means the opponent's move will be announced before you see the next card dealt, when the opponent is first to act. But don't worry, all actions are happening in order. 

# Bugs
There are no bugs. DO YOU HEAR ME? THERE ARE NO BUGS!!!

# Future work
- add stacks of chips instead of just showing the pot / bets as numbers
- add test cases to make sure the poker logic works
- add an event log for traceback purposes
- maybe like add a script or something to build the index.html lol idk man
